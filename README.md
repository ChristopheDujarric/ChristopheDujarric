ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chris!

I like to say that I'm the least technical person in the companies I worked at in the past 9 years.

I've had the chance to work with some of the top tech minds in the web at Symfony, Blackfire.io, Platform.sh and now Bump.sh. I must say, even though I'm learning a lot, I don't believe I'll ever get to their level.

So while I enjoy pushing some code to all sorts of repos, seing those lights turn green, and my PRs get merged, I'm focusing on the other parts of software:

- Product Management
- Product Marketing
- Sales
- Customer Experience
- Anything that will support tech teams in getting their software to markets.

Don't hesitate to reach out to me! I'm always happy to have a good chat on such topics.

And because I'm proud of my contributions, no matter how small they are:
